          "Get up and running with ReactJS by developing five cutting-edge and responsive projects About This Book Create pragmatic real-world applications while learning React and its modern developer tools Build sustainable user interfaces by transforming data into components of UI Learn how to generate reusable ReactJS components effectively Who This Book Is For If you are a web developer and wish to learn ReactJS from scratch, then this book is tailor-made for you. Good understanding of Javascript, HTML, and CSS is expected. What You Will Learn Create, reuse, and compose React components using JSX Share data between various React components and techniques for data flow within a React app Handle user interactions with the help of event handlers and dynamic components Set up and use various next generation ES2015/ES6 features with React Understand the performance and immutability features of React using React add-ons Learn the techniques of Animation in React Use data stores to store model-related data and information Create a flux-based React application by using Reflux library In Detail ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library that brings the power of reactive programming to web applications and sites. It aims to address the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications, and is intended to help developers build large, easily scalable and changing web apps. Starting with a project on Open Library API, you will be introduced to React and JSX before moving on to learning about the life cycle of a React component. In the second project, building a multi-step wizard form, you will learn about composite dynamic components and perform DOM actions. You will also learn about building a fast search engine by exploring server-side rendering in the third project on a search engine application. Next, you will build a simple frontpage for an e-commerce app in the fourth project by using data models and React add-ons. In the final project you will develop a complete social media tracker by using the flux way of defining React apps and know about the best practices and use cases with the help of ES6 and redux. By the end of this book, you will not only have a good understanding of ReactJS but will also have built your very own responsive frontend applications from scratch. Style and approach An easy-to-follow program to learn ReactJS with the help of real world projects. Each topic is explained within the context of a project and provides plenty of tips and tricks for using ReactJS.",

          "My fourth web development book is simply called React.js Book. It will walk you step by step through the process of setting up a development environment and learning Reactive programming from start to finish. React is a library unlike any other I have worked with. Unlike jQuery where you had to learn a number of methods that do very specific things, it's largely inspired by a programming methodology for creating fast web applications.In addition you will be expected to know or at least be briefly familiar with prerequisite knowledge of other web development tools such as Node.js, NPM, Babel, JSX and WebPack. These are not required elements of programming with React, but without them things would be tough.As of 2017, Reactive programming is an alternative way of thinking about web applications. It provides software patterns that make your web app extremely responsive to user input and generally feel faster to the end-user (people who are using your application.) The Virtual DOM alone is enough of a reason to switch to React. Programming with React library, is a lot more than just learning about and using React objects, components, states, props and methods. It requires previous experience with JavaScript and at times assumes knowledge of software principles not inherent to React library itself.This book is not a list of object names, methods and functions with side explanations of what they do. Rather, it deals with the said principles involved in React programming thought up by the creators of React library. Principles that are usually understood by professional web developers and software engineers.For all these reasons stated above, this book will gradually walk you through the process of becoming familiar with React library, starting from basic concepts. Gradually, we will move toward more advanced subjects. So, prepare to be educated",

          "In this book, we take you on a fun, hands-on and pragmatic journey to master React from a web development point of view. You'll start building React apps within minutes. Every section is written in a bite-sized manner and straight to the point as I don't want to waste your time (and most certainly mine) on the content you don't need. In the end, you will have what it takes to develop a real-life app.Facebook's React has changed the way we think about web applications and user interface development. Due to its design, you can use it beyond web. A feature known as the Virtual DOM enables this.In this chapter we'll go through some of the basic ideas behind the library so you understand React a little better before moving on.What is React?React is a JavaScript library that forces you to think in terms of components. This model of thinking fits user interfaces well. Depending on your background it might feel alien at first. You will have to think very carefully about the concept of state and where it belongs.Because state management is a difficult problem, a variety of solutions have appeared. In this book, we'll start by managing state ourselves and then push it to a Flux implementation known as Alt. There are also implementations available for several other alternatives, such as Redux, MobX, and Cerebral.React is pragmatic in the sense that it contains a set of escape hatches. If the React model doesn't work for you, it is still possible to revert back to something lower level. For instance, there are hooks that can be used to wrap older logic that relies on the DOM. This breaks the abstraction and ties your code to a specific environment, but sometimes that's the pragmatic thing to do.One of the fundamental problems of programming is how to deal with state. Suppose you are developing a user interface and want to show the same data in multiple places. How do you make sure the data is consistent?Historically we have mixed the concerns of the DOM and state and tried to manage it there. React solves this problem in a different way. It introduced the concept of the Virtual DOM to the masses.Virtual DOM exists on top of the actual DOM, or some other render target. It solves the state manipulation problem in its own way. Whenever changes are made to it, it figures out the best way to batch the changes to the underlying DOM structure. It is able to propagate changes across its virtual tree as in the image above.Virtual DOM PerformanceHandling the DOM manipulation this way can lead to increased performance. Manipulating the DOM by hand tends to be inefficient and is hard to optimize. By leaving the problem of DOM manipulation to a good implementation, you can save a lot of time and effort.React allows you to tune performance further by implementing hooks to adjust the way the virtual tree is updated. Though this is often an optional step.The biggest cost of Virtual DOM is that the implementation makes React quite big. You can expect the bundle sizes of small applications to be around 150-200 kB minified, React included. gzipping will help, but it's still big.",

          "Get a practical introduction to React Native, the JavaScript framework for writing and deploying fully featured mobile apps that render natively. The second edition of this hands-on guide shows you how to build applications that target iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms instead of browsers—apps that can access platform features such as the camera, user location, and local storage. Through code examples and step-by-step instructions, web developers and frontend engineers familiar with React will learn how to build and style interfaces, use mobile components, and debug and deploy apps. You’ll learn how to extend React Native using third-party libraries or your own Java and Objective-C libraries. Understand how React Native works under the hood with native UI components Examine how React Native’s mobile-based components compare to basic HTML elements Create and style your own React Native components and applications Take advantage of platform-specific APIs, as well as modules from the framework’s community Incorporate platform-specific components into cross-platform apps Learn common pitfalls of React Native development, and tools for dealing with them Combine a large application’s many screens into a cohesive UX Handle state management in a large app with the Redux library",
